        <h2 class="section">We Know how Hard it is to get Started</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Fortunately, we have compiled a comprehensive list to aid first-timers in their journeys below.</p>
        <h2 class="section">1. Shut her Locker</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">A classic move, but effective nonetheless. Wait until Vesna is not looking and quickly close her locker door. Bonus points if you can do it with a loud bang.</p>
        <h2 class="section">2. Hide her Books</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Take advantage of Vesna's forgetful nature by hiding her textbooks and notebooks. Just make sure to return them before she needs them for class. Or not. It doesn't matter.</p>
        <h2 class="section">3. Pull on her Backpack when She's not Looking</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">This one requires a bit of stealth. Wait until Vesna is walking down the hall and give her backpack a tug. Make sure you aren't caught sneaking up behind her or make your intentions too obvious</p>
        <h2 class="section">4. Call her "Vezna" instead of "Vesna"</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">A Freshman year fan-favorite unique to the art of Vezna Bullying. Her death glare, only known to happen after hearing the name "Vezna", is a surefire sign that you have successfully bullied Vesna</p>
        <h2 class="section">5. Trip her in the Hallway</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">This is a staple in Vesna bullying activities. Wait until Vesna is walking and give her a gentle nudge to make her stumble. Just be careful not to hurt her too much - we don't want any serious injuries I guess.</p>
        <p id="DISCLAIMER">DISCLAIMER: In case this website gets flagged and the deans happen to see this, this is all a joke approved by Vesna herself please don't give me an infraction</p>
